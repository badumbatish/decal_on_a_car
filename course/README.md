## Course overview:

### Course description

Welcome to CS197++ (see what i did there?) or CS198-XX - Introduction to Modern C++ presented by Jasmine Tang & friends.

In this course, we introduce you to the basics of modern C++ and provide you a firm start on how to start coding in C++ on your own.

The course leans off on student's CS61AB experience and transform them into C++, but much deeper.

### Course unit / Content

We hope to cover a lot of grounds; therefore, it is unavoidable that the class will be 3 units.

We hope to teach you from the ground up, from basics such as int, double to modern concepts such as iterators, templating, const correctness.

With "modern" as an objective in mind, we want to teach this C++ class in a way such that your code is cross-compilable across multiple platforms.

### Learning goals (what will students know, be able to do as a result of taking the class?)

After the class, we hope you will experience a blend between 3 things:

* A deep enough knowledge of C++.
* The ability to dig into a medium modern C++ codebase.
* Cool projects to showcase.

### Learning plan / activities

Every week, you will attend two lectures, each lasts 1.5 hours.

Each lecture has a short vitamin.

Each week has a set of homework A and B, respective of the first lecture and the second lecture in the week.

(Roughly) each month, we will have a project.

### How does the course fit within the program of study?

### How do the course goals support the program goals?

### How do the course goals align with the general education goals?

## Course requirements

### Course prerequisites (what prior knowledge, skills do students need for success?)

This is a fast-moving class. We require at least CS61A-B-C and CS162 as a pre-requisite.

### Tooling

The course requires a laptop to code on.

You will need

* A C++ compiler: gcc | clang | cl
* A Meta build-system: CMake
* A build system: make | ninja...
* A debugger : (c)gdb, or a debugger built into your IDE (i.e Clion, Visual Studio)

Clion is free for Berkeley students from&#x20;

## Grading

All DeCal is P/NP based. But we hope that this doesn't demotivate you from getting the most out of the class.

### Grading method

This class heavily employs token-based autograders through gradescope. Thus, this means that you are always graded on correctness.

We also expect your code to be cross-compilable. Thus, except for your vitamin, your solution will always be run through gradescope on multiple platform, each has equal portions of your grade:

* Windows (31%)
* Ubuntu (31%)
* Mac (31%)
* No-harm-in-trying point (7%, for submitting).

### Grading items

We define the grading to promote learning on your own. There will be no lecture attendance tracking. Students are free to go whenver they want to.

The following grade distribution has the "no-harm-in-trying" points baked into every section except the vitamin:

* Vitamin: 10%
* Homework: 15%
* Project 1: 25%
* Project 2: 25%
* Project 3: 25%

### Collaboration

Collaboration is encouraged in this course, throughout all exercises. We hope that by allowing this, we lessen your stress of having to complete and finish the exercises and enable you to focus more on understanding how to do things in C++ by communicating with your friends.
