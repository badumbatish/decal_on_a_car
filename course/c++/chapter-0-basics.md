# Chapter 0: Basics

##

In this section, we will be going over the basic syntax, control flow (for, while, range-based-for, if), functions w/ primitive args, overloading, variable declarations; (differences) stack + heap; automatic, dynamic, static, (thread\_local) storage durations; “abstract machine”; resources (standard, C++ ref, ISO CPP guidelines, totw)



## main.cpp

A C++ program needs to have a function named main to be an executable.

We usually call the source code of the executable with the same name: main.cpp

Below is a basic main.cpp file, with the function main, of type integer, returning 0.

Another way to write main.cpp is with the parameter _argc_ and _argv,_ respectively representing the number of arguments passed to the executable and the arguments passed to the programs:&#x20;
